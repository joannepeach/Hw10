# dome

My final project idea is to create a dome of lights that deactivates when individuals involved in an argument starts shouting.

### Summary

Using an arduino, it will have a grove sound sensor component that will be able to sense volume. Another element incorporated
within the dome will be a LED Lights that make up the dome shape. Thus, the lights will shine different colors of light when 
connected to power. However, the arduino will be programmed to sense volume when it gets too high causing the lights to shut off. 
While the dome is activated during the argument, it will record the duration and indicate moments when someone's voice grows 
too loud. Dome will be placed between two people in order for it to successfully interact. 

Dome's purpose is to regulate a peaceful arguing atmosphere. Our emotions tend to overtake our reasoning abilities and can cause
us to raise our voices. Thus, it overpowers another and creates an environment consisting of dominance. 
Dome hopes to prevent that and create a conscious atmosphere where one is respectful to another. 

### Component Parts

I plan to buy pieces that will be compatible with working with the arduino such as the Grove- Sound Sensor. Also, I 
want to lights that change in colors. 
Items: 
-Arduino (Input)
-LED Lights (Output)
-Sound Sensor (Input)
-Power supply (batteries)
-Some sort of screen that will show data of volume in recorded sound. (Input & Output)

### Challenges

The hardest part will be figuring out how to create the most accurate way to determining when an argument is getting out of 
hand. Figuring out how to record the data and display it in an understandable format will be my greatest challenge. 

### Timeline

What parts of the project do you anticipate you will complete in each of the next 5 weeks? 
Your goal is to solve the scary problems as quickly as possible! 

- Week 1: Write proposal
- Week 2: Search methods to go about building anatomy of project and buy materials
- Week 3: build and cry from stress and build again
- Week 4: refine building and hopefully be done
- Week 5: Present!
